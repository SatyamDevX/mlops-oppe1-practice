# 🌸 Iris Dataset – Data Poisoning Simulation & Mitigation

## 👤 Author
**Satyam Srivastava**

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objective

- Integrate **data poisoning** into the Iris dataset using randomly generated numbers at different levels: **5%, 10%, and 50%**.
- Train a machine learning model on each poisoned dataset.
- Evaluate the effect of data poisoning on model performance.
- Provide insights and mitigation strategies for such attacks.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install pandas scikit-learn
````

---

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python poison_experiment.py
```

The script will:

* Apply random poisoning to 5%, 10%, and 50% of the data.
* Train a `RandomForestClassifier` on each poisoned dataset.
* Print classification reports (precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy).

## 🧠 Results & Observations

| Poisoning Level | Accuracy | Macro F1-Score | Observation                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 5%              | 89%      | 90%            | Model performance still strong               |
| 10%             | 87%      | 87%            | Slight drop, especially in `virginica` class |
| 50%             | 61%      | 61%            | Major degradation, model is unreliable       |

## ⚠️ What is Data Poisoning?

Data poisoning is a form of adversarial attack where malicious or corrupted samples are injected into training data to **degrade the model's performance** or manipulate its behavior.

In this experiment, poisoning was simulated by **replacing random samples' feature values** with uniformly generated noise within each feature's value range.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy                    | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Validation**         | Use z-score, IQR, or clustering to detect feature outliers before training |
| **Feature Drift Detection** | Continuously monitor data distributions and statistics                     |
| **Robust Models**           | Use models like RANSAC or incorporate adversarial training                 |
| **Human-in-the-loop**       | Manual verification steps during data ingestion                            |
| **Ensemble Learning**       | Use voting or bagging to minimize effect of poisoned inputs                |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Even small levels of poisoning (5–10%) begin to affect class-level metrics, while large-scale poisoning (50%) can render the model ineffective. Therefore, **early detection and data validation pipelines** are critical components of a secure and reliable MLOps workflow.
